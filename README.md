# Ybif-ML-Internship
Projects and Codes of Machine Learning Internship at YBIF, Where I worked through the following projects.

** 1) Predicting the compressive strength of concrete: **

   DATASET DESCRIPTION:
 
   -> Cement (cement) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Blast Furnace Slag (slag) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Fly Ash (ash) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Water (water) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
   
   -> Superplasticizer (superplastic) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Coarse Aggregate (coarseagg) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Fine Aggregate (fineagg) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
 
   -> Age(age) -- quantitative -- Day (1~365) -- Input Variable
 
   -> Concrete compressive strength(strength) -- quantitative -- MPa -- Output Variable

2)To Identify Employee Attrition by using Classification Model:

The focus of this project is the application of machine learning Model (Random Forest), and its suitability to identify Employee Attrition compared with early models obtained from the literature and also a recommendation system is developed by applying Random Forest Classifier, to predict the Employee Attrition from its components accurately and then looking for the optimal combination of components.

3)Identify Multiple Disease by using Classification Model:

The focus of this project is the application of machine learning Model (Random Forest), and its suitability to identify Multiple Disease compared with early models obtained from the literature and also a recommendation system is developed by applying Random Forest Classifier, to predict the Multiple Disease from its components accurately and then looking for the optimal combination of components.
